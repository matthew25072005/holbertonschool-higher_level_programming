"""Creating a class named CountedIterator that extends
the built-in iterator obtained from the iter function.
The CountedIterator should keep track of the number of
items that have been iterated over. Specifically,
you will need to override the __next__ method to
increment a counter each time an item is fetched. Get_count is used to return current value of the counter"""
